              One of the Penstraat flagship restaurant, Fishalicious, will be moving to a new location, with owners hoping to completethe move by the end of 2017. Culinary visitors will be relieved to hear the new location will remain within the Penstraat. After steering a steady ship for nearly 8 years, the finest fish restaurant Fishalicious is planning to move up the street to a new, larger location - several-times the size of its current spot. Currently not much more than a ruin of what once was, but the (re)building work has started and we will update the story when new milestones are achieved.

              The oldest operating hotel on Curacao, the Avila Hotel, was recently sold to the Vogels family, who already owns the well-known property Lions Dive & Beach Resort. With the new ownership, the property has commenced a complete rebranding with the new name “Avila Beach Hotel,” as well as an extensive beach upgrade and room renovation. The Avila Beach Hotel remains to be one of the few family owned hotels on the island. Son of owner Will Vogels, Robbin Vogels, took over the General Manager position from Paul Kok, as of June 2016.
